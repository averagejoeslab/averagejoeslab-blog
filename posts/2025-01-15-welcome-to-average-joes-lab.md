# Welcome to Average Joes Lab

Welcome to **Average Joes Lab** - where ordinary people do extraordinary research! I'm thrilled to introduce you to our mission of democratizing research and pulling it out of the exclusive hands of traditional academia and corporations.

## Why Average Joes Lab Exists

For too long, research has been gatekept by institutions, creating barriers that prevent brilliant minds from contributing to human knowledge simply because they lack the "right" credentials or institutional affiliations. **We're changing that.**

At Average Joes Lab, we believe that:
- **Curiosity knows no boundaries** - Anyone with genuine interest can contribute to research
- **Innovation comes from diversity** - The best solutions emerge when different perspectives collaborate
- **Knowledge should be free** - Research findings belong to humanity, not behind paywalls
- **Community beats competition** - Collaborative research produces better outcomes than isolated efforts

## What Makes Us Different

### **Open by Default**
Every piece of research, methodology, and finding from our community is **completely open access**. No paywalls, no institutional barriers, no gatekeeping.

### **Community-Driven Peer Review**
Instead of relying on traditional academic peer review (which can take months or years), we use **community-driven review processes** that value merit over credentials.

### **Practical Focus**
We don't just theorize - we build, test, and implement. Our research has **real-world applications** and aims to solve actual problems.

### **Mentorship & Support**
New to research? No problem! Our community includes experienced research engineers who provide **mentorship and guidance** to help you succeed.

## Our Research Areas

We're focused on cutting-edge areas where citizen researchers can make meaningful contributions:

### **AI & Machine Learning Research**
